# React Boilerplate

This is a template for react web applications. This is very much a work in progress. I'm also not necessarily recommending this setup. I'm still learning many of these tools and don't know how I feel about all of them yet.

# Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd <repo path>`
3. `npm install`
4. `gulp`
5. `node src/server.js`
6. Visit `http://localhost:3000/`
