# React Boilerplate

This is a template for react web applications. This is very much a work in progress. I'm also not necessarily recommending this setup, I'm still learning many of these tools and don't know how I feel about all of them yet.

# Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd <repo path>`
3. `npm install`
