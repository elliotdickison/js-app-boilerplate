# JavaScript App Starter Kit

This is a starter kit for universal react/redux javascript web applications. This is very much a work in progress. I'm also not necessarily recommending this setup. I'm still learning many of these tools and don't know how to use them or how I feel about them*.

\* Update: React, Redux, and Babel are the cat's pajamas, the bee's knees, and the dog's galoshes.

# Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` into the repo base directory
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to build and run in development mode

# Features

* Universal - data fetching + rendering on both sides of the fence
* Immutable - state + UI
* Testable - TAP with tape
* Developable (?) - hot module replacement + in-browser error display + redux dev tools
