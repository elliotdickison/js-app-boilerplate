# JavaScript App Boilerplate

This is a template for universal ("isomorphic") javascript web applications. This is very much a work in progress. I'm also not necessarily recommending this setup. I'm still learning many of these tools and don't know how to use them or how I feel about them*.

\* Update: React, Redux, and Babel are the cat's pajamas, the bee's knees, and the dog's galoshes.

# Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` into the repo base directory
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run build` to build assets
5. Run `npm run test` to test
6. Run `npm start` to start
